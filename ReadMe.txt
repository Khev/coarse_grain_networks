The .dat file contais the CDL data. 

The fractal notebooks are Daniel's work, from which I took some functions to read the CDL data (.ipynb is an Interactive PYthon NoteBook, while the .py is a normal python file, although since it was created from the .ipynb, it contains commands like <cell>, left over from original format). 

GenerateRipsComplex.ipynb, as the name suggests, is the main file. The execution time becomes ~ hours for rips radius ~ 6 units = 6 x 30m. 

make_mesh.ipynb is intermediary rough work.

XWheatResults are the positions of XWheat as [[x1,y1], [x2,y2], â€¦.], exported using the pickle function.

Clumping.ipynb is a work-in-progress to coarse-grain graphs without destroying behavior. Specifically, the number of connected components.
